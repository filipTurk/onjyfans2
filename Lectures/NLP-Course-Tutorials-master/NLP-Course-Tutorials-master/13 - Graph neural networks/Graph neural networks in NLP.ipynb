    "## Graph neural networks\n",
    "Graph neural networks are neural networks that accept graphs as inputs. Their goal is to encode information about the local structure of the graph around a node in a vector that represents each node. Depending on the task the output of a graph neural network can be embeddings for each node or a single vector for an entire graph."

    "### Graph\n",
    "A graph consists of nodes that are connected with edges. When talking about graph neural networks each node is represented by a vector of features. If the nodes do not have any features associated with them, we can generate generic feature vectors (vector of size 1 with value 1, or unit vectors of size n where n is the number of nodes).\n",
    "\n",
    "![](graph.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Nodes and edges can have features. Node features are required for graph neural networks, while some implementations of the graph convolutions can also use the edge features:\n",
    "![](graph-features.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The edge features can have different complexities:\n",
    "- binary: nodes are/are not connected\n",
    "- multiple edge types: each edge is assigned a type\n",
    "- single continuous value: each edge has a weight\n",
    "- feature vectors: each edge has a vector of features (this is the most complex)"

    "### Graph convolution\n",
    "The idea behind graph neural networks is that on each step a node gets some information from its neighbours. This way the node learns information about the local graph structure as well as the features of the nearby nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Performing a graph convolution operation\n",
    "**General process**:\n",
    "1. Take feature vectors of neighbours\n",
    "    - Defined by the adjacency matrix\n",
    "    - Can also include self loops\n",
    "2. Transform feature vectors\n",
    "    - Usually a single layer is used for transformation\n",
    "    - The weights for the transformation are shared between all nodes (that makes this operation a convolution)\n",
    "4. Aggregate feature vectors\n",
    "    - Aggregation function needs to be order invariant (the order of neighbours should not matter)\n",
    "    - The aggregation function can include attention mechanism to weight the neighbours\n",
    "    - The most common aggregation function is SUM with some normalization (based on the number of neighbours)\n",
    "5. Update\n",
    "    - Include the original feature vector\n",
    "    - Not strictly necessary (we can replace this step with self loops)\n",
    "\n",
    "![](aggregation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The end result of the graph convolutions is a graph where the feature vectors of the nodes are different. This is useful when our goal is to predict some characteristic of a node. In some cases we would like to predict characteristic of an entire graph.\n",
    "#### Graph classification\n",
    "When predicting graph level features our goal is to end up with a single vector that describes the entire graph. We achieve this by using pooling layers. The common pooling mechanisms are to compute the average or a maximum of the node vectors. In some cases we loose too much information by pooling over the entire graph. In these cases it might be useful to divide the nodes in a graph into multiple groups and do the pooling operation over each group separately. This way we end up with a smaller graph where we can repeat the pooling part until we get a single vector."

In our case the nodes represent individual tokens, so we can use token embeddings to represent nodes. The quality of the embeddings has a large effect on the performance of the model. Spacy already provides a way to get token embeddings by using the **vector** attribute of the token class. The embeddings that we get depend on the language model that we use. We will use the vectors provided by the **en_core_web_lg** model. The model provides 300 dimensional vectors for 685k unique tokens. The vectors are computed using the word2vec algorithm."

    "**Graph convolutions**:\n",
    "There are many different implementations for computing graph convolutions implemented in PyTorch geometric library. We will take a look at the *GCNConv* layer since it is the most basic and simple to understand convolutional layer.\n",
    "**Initialization**: We provide the size of the node embeddings on the input and the size of node embeddings on the output.\n",
    "**Running**: GCNConv accepts a matrix representing node embeddings and the edge index matrix. It returns the matrix of new embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other types of convolutions can be found in the [PyTorch geometric documentation](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/nn.html)\n",
    "Some more useful ones include:\n",
    "- **GCNConv** is the basic implementation of the layer that we described above.\n",
    "- **RGCNConv** supports multiple edge types. When using it we can provide additional argument called *edge_type* that holds a list of all edge types as integers.\n",
    "- **GINConv** convolution layer accepts a *nn* parameter that defines a module that is used to transform a node vector after the aggregation in the convolution step.\n",
    "- **GINEConv** is a modified version of GINConv. It adds support for edge features. It accepts the *edge_attr* parameter that defines the features for each edge in the *edge_index* matrix.\n",
    "- **GATConv** allows the use of attention when computing convolution operations."

    "One of the challenges that we commonly come across when working with graph neural networks is how to group nodes in batches to be computed in parallel. The **torch_geometric.loader.DataLoader** class helps us with this by grouping graphs together into a larger batch.\n",
    "The DataLoader class automatically transforms the node features (x) and the edge matrix (edge_index) to generate a larger graph made up of the original graphs in a batch. It also adds the *batch* attribute that records the batch that each node came from. The transformation applied to custom attributes depends on their name. By default, the result will be a list of values from all graphs. For example elements with the word *index* in their name will get automatically incremented.\n",
