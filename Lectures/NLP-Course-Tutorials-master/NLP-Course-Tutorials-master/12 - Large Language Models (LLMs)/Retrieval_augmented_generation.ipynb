        "The core functionality of this notebook is to create a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system that enables discussion about the NLP subject setting using the `Mistral-7b-v0.2` model.\n",
        "\n",
        "General-purpose language models can be fine-tuned for common tasks such as sentiment analysis and named entity recognition, which typically do not require additional background knowledge.\n",
        "\n",
        "For more complex and knowledge-intensive tasks, it is possible to construct a language model-based system that accesses external knowledge sources. This approach enhances factual consistency, improves the reliability of responses, and mitigates the issue of 'hallucination.'\n",
        "\n",
        "Researchers have introduced the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) method to address these knowledge-intensive tasks. RAG integrates an information retrieval component with a text generator model, allowing for efficient updates and modifications to its internal knowledge without retraining the entire model.\n",
        "\n",
        "RAG operates by taking an input, retrieving a set of relevant or supporting documents from a source like Wikipedia, and concatenating these documents with the original input prompt. This concatenated context is then fed to the text generator, which produces the final output. This adaptability is crucial for situations where facts may evolve over time, as the static parametric knowledge of traditional large language models (LLMs) can become outdated. RAG circumvents the need for retraining, providing access to the most current information and enabling reliable outputs through retrieval-based generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "RAG requires additional document embeddings and the storage of documents in a database for retrieval purposes.\n"

All the work is graded following the scoring schema below. To successfully pass the laboratory work, you need to pass Submission 1 and 2, and gain 50% total from each of Submission 3 and Peer review. Use PUBLIC GROUP ID for public communication regarding your group. GROUP ID is your internal id of a group for which marks will be publicly available. ScoringScoring is done relative to achievements of all the participants in the course. Instructions will define the criteria the participants need to address and exactly fulfilling the instructions will result in score 8. All the other scores will be relative to the quality of the submitted work. The role of instructors is to find an appropriate clustering of all the works into 6 clusters. To better illustrate the scoring, schema will be as follows:10 - exceptional: Extraordinary results, quality of work or extremely well structured and justified report. There might still be some very minor possibilities for improvement.Repository is clear and runnable. Report is well organized, results are discussed, visualizations are added value to the text and well prepared. Apart from minimum criteria the group tried multiple of their novel ideas to approach the problem.9 - very good: Above average knowledge presentation with some errors. Same as above - it can be visible that a group had novel ideas but they got out of time or did not finish (polish) everything. The submission has multiple minor flaws.8 - good: Submission of solid work, mainly addressing given instructions only.Group implemented everything suggested by the minimum criteria but not investigated further (not found much related work, did not apply multiple other techniques, ...). 7 - superficial: Below average knowledge and submission of work with errors that show partial understanding.Group implemented everything suggested by the minimum criteria but did not discuss results well, performed simple analyses only, ... Also the report is not well organized, and lacks data for reproducibility.6 - sufficient: Minimum criteria addressed with some major errors and drawbacks.Group was trying to implement minimum criteria (or part only) but their work has many minor flaws or a few major ones. The report also reflects their motivation.5 - insufficient: \\xa0Too much lack of knowledge, too many major errors or no work-effort could be drawn from the submitted work.The group did not address one or more points of the minimum criteria and the report contains major flaws. It can be seen that the group did not invest enough time into the work.Final project preparation guidelines and peer review instructionsSome major remarks that you should keep in mind out are the following regarding final submission:Comment on all the specifics of your algorithms that you use or have designed (i.e. features, hyperparameters, ...). In some cases it is useful to include an image instead of providing long descriptions. When you include graphs/images, they must be readable and provide additional insight (e.g. if there are lots of lines across the image or little space between them, it is not okay). When you report on results, keep them as much as possible in one table, so that a reader can compare different configurations. Also, it is useful to bold the best results. Both images and tables should be self-contained - i.e., together with the caption they need to provide enough information to the reader to understand it\\'s meaning without reading text around.Keep your report concise and try to not submit a report longer than 4 pages + references + appendices. Also, make sure you follow the proposed template.Focus on reporting results and using sensible measures. Try to find examples where your algorithm works better and may not even work at all. Explain why and also justify the differences in approaches that you used. In case previous work exists for your dataset, put the best results of other researchers in your results table (even if your results are much lower).Your submitted work (repository and report) should be structured in a way that your colleagues would be able to understand and re-run everything. Include all dependencies for you projects:In case you have used a non-public (or semi-public) dataset, do not include it in the repository, just put your contact data or protected link to download data/provide other instructions to retrieve data.Datasets that are available elsewhere should be just linked in your report/repository. If you performed additional transformations on datasets, scripts for that should be available in the repository.Some of you used models that take longer to train. You can include those models (maybe just the best one) in the repository or elsewhere and link it. Lastly, check that your repositories are publicly available before the peer review period starts! IMPORTANT:Include links to all dependencies/corpora or include them in the repository, so that anyone can check your work. Also include annotated data (if you manually prepared a corpus) or trained models (if training takes a long time).For anyone that will review your work, it must be as simple as possible to run your code.Peer review instructions:Please find the projects you need to review (see link above).Each group needs to review projects of the same topic they have chosen. Submit your peer review scores in the Google Form (see link above).You will get a score also for your grading, depending on how much (of course by some margin) your grading will be different from the assistant\\'s grading. Follow the scoring criteria as presented above and include feedback to your mark.Final project presentation instructionsEach group will have max. 3 minutes (STRICT)\\xa0to present their project. I will put your report to the projector and you will present it along with your report. I propose that you focus on specific interesting part that you will present (e.g., table, graph, figure, ...). The most important aspect to present is:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0What is the \"take-away message\" of your work? This should be concrete and concise, so that anyone can understand (also a completely lay person).See timetable above for time slots of your presentation. If you cannot attend, please write to me to get an alternative time slot.Specific projects informationProject 1: Conversational Agent with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Aleš): Develop a conversational agent that enhances the quality and accuracy of its responses by dynamically retrieving and integrating relevant external documents from the web. Unlike traditional chatbots that rely solely on pre-trained knowledge, this system will perform real-time information retrieval, ensuring up-to-date answers. Potential applications include customer support, academic research assistance, and general knowledge queries. The project will involve natural language processing (NLP), web scraping, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to optimize answer quality.Proposed methodology:Literature review: Survey current approaches to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and its applications in conversational systems.Propose a relevant application and relevant datasets for training and evaluation.Implement a pipeline for real-time information retrieval from external sources (e.g., Wikipedia, news articles, or academic papers), develop a conversational agent that incorporates retrieved information into responses using pre-trained models, experiment with prompt engineering techniques to improve coherence and factual accuracy of generated responses.Evaluate response quality automatically using BLEU, ROUGE, and also human evaluation metrics such as coherence, informativeness, and factual consistency.Prepare a final report with insights on how retrieval-augmented conversational agents can enhance answer quality in real-world applications.References:Gao, Y. et al.

The project involves training deep learning models on datasets such as DBpedia and other relevant sources with a goal to produce balanced instruction-following capabilities in AI systems and detect their weak areas (domains) as well. The classifier should effectively distinguish different instruction types and improve dataset organization to support instruction-tuned LLMs. Proposed methodology:Literature review: Conduct a survey of current approaches to text classification, focusing on instruction-tuning datasets and their categorization. Review different strategies for creation of instruction tuning datasets (see Čibej and Touron et al. references).Identify and acquire relevant datasets. In this step, the main objective is to find relevant datasets that will help to organize and find weaknesses of the Slovene instruction-following dataset (http://hdl.handle.net/11356/1971). \\xa0Students should compare the Slovene dataset with existing English datasets, and find which areas are less covered or missing in the Slovene version (type of instruction, domains, etc.). Fine-tune pre-trained models on the selected datasets, optimizing for multi-label classification. Generate new instruction-tuning samples for less-covered areas. Assess model performance using appropriate classification metrics. Evaluate manually generated instruction-tuned samples using appropriate metrics. Provide insights on improving instruction dataset classification for AI models and prepare a final project report.References:Zhang, Shengyu et al.

Project 3: Improving prompt sensitivity of LLMs (Aleš): This project aims to experiment with techniques to reduce the sensitivity of large language models (LLMs) to variations in user prompts. Often, minor changes in phrasing can lead to significantly different responses, affecting consistency and reliability. Students will explore methods such as prompt paraphrasing, fine-tuning with slightly altered prompts to make LLM outputs more stable across semantically similar queries. The project will involve generating diverse paraphrases of prompts, analyzing model behavior, and fine-tuning responses to enhance reliability. This research is crucial for improving LLM usability in real-world applications, ensuring more consistent and predictable answers. Proposed methodology:Literature review: Review techniques used in prompt engineering, adversarial robustness, and controlled text generation.Select a dataset: Identify and curate datasets with diverse prompt variations, slightly altered prompts, etc. Implement and test various techniques for overcoming prompt sensitivity: paraphrase generation techniques, etc.Conduct human evaluation and measure response consistency using automated metrics.Prepare report and analyze results to determine which techniques most effectively reduce prompt sensitivity.References:Mizrahi, M. et al.

Students will evaluate how different models handle translations, identifying common errors such as mistranslations, omissions, and cultural misinterpretations. Additionally, the project will explore biases that emerge in translations, including gender, regional, and political biases. By systematically comparing multiple LLMs, students will assess translation quality using both automated metrics and human evaluations. The findings will help improve fairness and accuracy in AI-driven translation systems.Proposed methodology:Literature review: Conduct a survey of research on translation errors and biases in large language models (LLMs).Define a problem and select an appropriate dataset. Problems should be specific: Examine bias-related issues, such as gender bias in pronoun translation, political bias in news articles.Choose one open-source and one closed-source model. Experiment with various prompt techniques related to your project goal. Develop and perform qualitative analysis of translation errors and biases. Prepare a final report with detailed observations, qualitative analysis, and practical suggestions for future improvements. \\xa0References:Roberto Navigli, Simone Conia, and Björn Ross. 2023.
