But more extraordinarily, the researchers found that the mineral contains about 1% water.\\nWhile this sounds like very little, because ringwoodite makes up almost all of this immense portion of the deep Earth, it adds up to a huge amount of deep water.\\nDr Sally Gibson from the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the work, commented: \"Finding water in such large concentrations is a hugely significant development in our understanding of the ultimate origin of water now present at Earth's surface.\"\\nThe observation is the first physical evidence that water can be stored in the deep interiors of planets and solves a 25-year-old controversy about whether the deep Earth is dry, wet, or wet in patches.\\nDiscussing his findings, Prof Pearson told BBC News: \"The discovery highlights the unique value of natural diamonds in trapping and preserving fragments of the deep Earth.\\n\"It's incredible to think that, as you hold this sample in your hand, the residual pressure at the interface between the diamond and the inclusion is 20,000 atmospheres.\"\\nDescribing his diamond sample, he said: \"It looks like it's been to hell and back, which it has.\"\\nProf Joseph Smyth of the University of Colorado has spent many years studying ringwoodite and similar minerals synthesised in his laboratory.\\nHe said: \"I think it's stunning! It implies that the interior may store several times the amount of water in the oceans. It tells us that hydrogen is an essential ingredient in the Earth and not added late from comets.\\n\"This discovery implies that hydrogen may control the interior processes of the Earth just as it controls the surface processes, and that water planets, like Earth, may be common in our galaxy.\"\\nA key question posed by the observation is to understand the extent to which plate tectonics on Earth leads to oceans of water being recycled deep within our planet, and to predict the likely amounts of water trapped in other rocky planets.\\nRingwoodite is expected to form deep in Mars as well, for example, where it sits against the metallic core.\\nGrains of the same mineral synthesised in Prof Smyth's laboratory shine bright blue under the microscope.\\nGiven the new findings of ringwoodite's water-bearing capabilities, its abundance at depth, and its beautiful hue, the term \"blue planet\" seems even more appropriate for Earth.</td>\n",

It was closer to 40% in the other two events.\\n\"If these events start coming as frequently as every five to 10 years there will not be sufficient coral regeneration,\" he said.\\nTourism to the Great Barrier Reef generates $A5bn ($3.9b, Â£2.7bn) each year and employs around 70,000 people, the National Coral Bleaching Taskforce said.\\n\"Thankfully many parts of the reef are still in excellent shape,\" said Daniel Gschwind, chief executive of the Queensland Tourism Industry Council in a statement.\\n\"But we can't just ignore coral bleaching and hope for a swift recovery.\"\\nThe current worldwide bleaching event, which is also affecting reefs on Australia's north-west coast, is predicted to be the worst on record.\\nThe Australian Department of Environment previously said that state and federal governments were investing a projected A$2bn over the next decade to protect the reef.</td>\n",

It measures the quality of a summary by the number of overlapping units (n-grams, sequences of texts, etc.) between summaries created by humans and summaries created by summarization systems. ROUGE is not a single metric but a family of metrics. The most commonly used are ROUGE-N and ROUGE-L. The first measures the overlapping of n-grams (typically unigrams and bigrams), while the second measures the longest common subsequence found in both summaries.\n",

        "- **Conciseness**: Does the summary eliminate redundant or non-essential information, presenting the core message efficiently?\n",
        "- **Coherence and Structure**: Is the summary logically structured, easy to follow, and coherent in its presentation?\n",
        "- **Readability**: Is the summary well-written, with proper grammar, punctuation, and an appropriate style for the intended audience?\n",

        "- **Referential Clarity**: Are the pronouns and terms used in the summary clearly linked to their referents?\n",
